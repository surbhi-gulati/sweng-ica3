Critiques for Whitney's code:

1. Use good names 
Time is poorly named and unclear as to what it attributes. Can rename to convey
`seconds left at current light` more descriptively.

2. Make your data mean something
The time variable is crucial to the program and as such merits a more specific type
name than `number`.

3. One method / one job
This is fairly well done but in `colorAtNextSecond` it is implicitly tracking both the
color cycle order and tracking time event changes. This can see improvement by delegating
the color cycle to be better tracked through an external variable.

4. Don't repeat yourself
As mentioned in point 3 we are iterating through all colors in a switch case when instead
we can simplify the problem of handling what colors we should be seeing. As we expand the 
program this is going to require a lot of extra encoding about the color cycle.

5. Don't hardcode things that are likely to change
The order of the colors in `colorAtNextSecond` and the 20 second magic number in
`timerAtNextSecond` are both values that might change. They should be defined external
to their respective functions.

Critiques for our own code:

1. We restrict to the 3 Color options we provide, but in order to be more extensive (don't
hardcode things that are likely to change) we can expand this definition to accept custom
strings from users. This tradeoff is possible when we cease to assume that we only have
ability to communicate with the hardware about a traditional red-yellow-green light set-up.

2. Duration per light is fixed and cannot be sent in as a different value based on the 
temporal conditions. In traffic time we may want to make adjustments to duration, so this is
also a constant value that we may not want to have assigned. Instead, we can build a more
dynamic set of parameters. To make our code more flexible to extensions we may build a way
to update our LightColorDuration data based on event-driven architecture.

3. We can make our code more DRY (as a code-safety concern) by having a constant set of values
that all of these functions use for `LightColorDuration`. Otherwise, if we pass different 
information in to the two functions - and others - our system will not be in sync over the same data.
